l17 = ["The course introduces students to the development of industrial relations and labour laws in Singapore. Students can thus understand why labour relations are the way they are in Singapore.

This course is offered to BTech students only.","This course will introduce students to the dynamics of the world economy and the impact on Singapore in the last two centuries. It will demonstrate how Singapore grew through continual dependence on the rest of the world in different ways by focusing on major labour, capital and technological factors, in which threats are also seen as opportunities.","This module attempts to understand the rationale of changes in Singapore's urban landscape. It places these changes within a framework that considers Singapore's efforts to globalise and examines how policies are formulated with the idea of sustaining an economy that has integral links sub-regionally with Southeast Asia while developing new spatial linkages that will strengthen its position in the global network. Emphasis is also given to recent discussions about how diversity and difference in the perception and use of space pose a challenge to the utilitarian and functional definition adopted by the state.","The module will focus on the functions of the biophysical environment of the city state of Singapore. The topics include geology, soils, river systems, water supply, natural reserves, green areas, land reclamation and coastal environments. The environmental problems that arise from the development of a large tropical city within a limited area, and the possible solutions for such problems will be examined. The module does not require an extensive science or mathematics background.","Studies on the everyday life of ordinary people offer an important perspective for understanding human history. This module examines the daily life of Chinese Singaporeans during the late 19th to 20th centuries, focusing on their cultural expressions and social actions, revolving around eight geo-cultural sites, namely, Singapore River, Chinatown, Chinese temples, clan associations, opera stages, amusement parks, hawker centres, and streets/roads. Students are asked to compare the past and present of these sites through oral history and fieldwork observation.","The module aims to examine the evolving economic linkages between Singapore and India in a post Cold War setting and attempts to explain the factors that have led to their enhanced economic collaboration based on areas of complementarity. The module will use concepts like economic regionalism, Singapore's regionalization policy and India's policies to explain the confluence of national interests that has enhanced bilateral economic ties between both countries. In particular it will examine bilateral collaboration in infrastructure development (ports and telecommunications) and services (airline and tourism) industries to explain the success and problems of bilateral economic collaboration. The target audiences are students from various Faculties who would like to have a better understanding of Singapore's evolving foreign economic policy in South Asia in an increasingly globalised economy.","The South Asian presence in Singapore is an important part of Singapore's multicultural society: in terms of the 'Indian' community and its economic and commercial influence; its religious and artistic impact; and its role in the everyday life of the nation (eg. cuisine, sport and entertainment). Students will be provided the opportunity to understand the nature of South Asian migration to Singapore, the significance of the South Asian community and its contributions to Singapore's development.

Yet, as we all know, the evolution of Singapore, from classical regional emporium to international port city and strategic naval base, has all along been defined by much larger regional and international forces. After its emergence as a sovereign state in 1965, Singapore continues to project itself as a 'global city-state'. Our local society has an 'international' make-up, being the product as it were of historical and current diasporic trends. This module provides an international framework for a study of the history of Singapore, and seeks to examine the historical evolution of Singapore against the contexts of regional and international changes and developments from the 14th to the 20th century. This module is open to all students throughout NUS interested in Singapore history/studies.","Popular Culture in Singapore is designed for both History and non-History students to look at the development of popular culture in Singapore from the colonial period to the present day.

The module will explore the thought of Muslims thinkers on issues of reform relevant to the Malays of Singapore. A critical analysis and evaluation of the phenomenon of Islamic resurgence and revivalism in Singapore and the extent of its contribution to the progress of the community will also be explored. A theme underlying the topics of the module is the relevance of Islamic values and philosophy in facilitating Singaporean Malays adapt to the demands of social change and the plural society in which they live.","This module aims to promote a better understanding of Singapore-Japan relations, combining historical, political, economic, social and cultural perspectives.

This module is open to all undergraduates who are interested in Singapore?s physical development.","Located within one of the global centres of biodiversity, Singapore is endowed with a rich natural heritage that is impacted by expanding urbanisation. Development poses a great challenge to nature conservation and Singapore is an excellent model to study how a balance can be achieved. Students will be introduced to the country?s natural heritage, its historical, scientific and potential economic value. You will have the opportunity to explore important habitats, and to think critically about the issues of sustainable development and the nation?s responsibility to posterity and to regional and international conventions related to biodiversity conservation.
